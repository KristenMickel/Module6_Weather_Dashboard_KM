## Description
For this assignment, I was tasked with creating a Weather Dashboard which could retrieve the forecast for a set selection of major cities in the USA using the Open Weather Map “5 Day Weather Forecast”. I was not able to fully implement this function since I do not have time to wait to receive the API from the Open Weather Map site, but I put a comment in my HTML file for where it should be placed.
